**Description:**
This is a fully interactive, browser-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, aimed at demonstrating front-end development skills and clean UI design.

**Features:**
Two-Player Game Logic: Allows two users to take turns with “O” and “X”.
Winner Detection: The game automatically detects winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals).
Reset & New Game Options: Users can reset or start a new game at any point using intuitive buttons.
Dynamic Win Message: Shows a congratulatory message with the winner's symbol.
Responsive Design: Uses flexible vmin units and flexbox to adapt across various screen sizes.
Styled UI: A clean, colorful interface with smooth interactions and button states.

**Tech Stack:**
HTML5 – Structure and layout
CSS3 – Styling with flexbox and modern responsive units
JavaScript (ES6) – Game logic, DOM manipulation, event handling

**What I Learned:**
DOM manipulation and event-driven programming
Managing UI state transitions (active turn, winner display)
Structuring code modularly for better maintainability
Designing a responsive and visually appealing layout

**How to Play:**
Open the game in any modern browser.
Players take turns clicking boxes to mark “O” or “X”.
Once a winning condition is met, the game stops and announces the winner.
Click "Start New Game" or "Reset" to play again.
